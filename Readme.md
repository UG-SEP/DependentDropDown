To use this project in your local computer you must download Django latest version

How this dependent dropdown project is done and what are the technologies used?

I used Django to create this project and used ajax to send and recieve data to the server without loading the page.

In the project I created a form which takes the name, country,state,district and city name through a dropdown input and save that into a 'Form' named model and you can also view the data of the users

How can you access the django admin page?

Go to web browser and type 'localhost:8000/admin' and use the username and password given below

Username: ug
Password: 1

Now the admin page is accessible to you

Thank you
